# Shogi
Console shogi program written for F# practice

This has ended up being an odd project to use F# for. Seems most effective to use Arrays, but those are mutable, and so by the end of it this isn't going to be a project making very heavy use of the functional capabilities of F#. 
Progress here will probably be slow.
